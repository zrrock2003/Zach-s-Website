About Me
</h>

<p>
HI, my name is Zachary Rock. I am currently a senior in CVU, and am working full time at the Shaw's in Williston. I am currently learning computer programming for my Grad. Challenge because I have taken an interst on how machines are coded, and how they are told to do certain things that make them act the way they do. I have always been a technological kid, and I think as the future continues to grow more nad more, it would be cool to see how computer programming plays a huge part into it.
</p>

<h> How I Started
</h>

<p> I started computer programming by getting into the interest about how do codes make a things work, and I wanted to know more than the simplisity of it, so I took actions into my own hands and saw Grad. Challenge as a way to do it. From there, I knew Charlie McFayden would know someone because he is into coding and all this technological stuff so my best bet of getting a community consultant was through maybe he knew someone. Since chatting with Brian i've learned more and more, and i knew this could be another potential pathway to take in life because not a lot of people know computer programming and it is a really hard field to get into and stay invested in. Plus, the future is all going to be technology anyways so it would be a good thing to know it case I need to code something for a business I own or maybe help a friend out with something.
</p>

<h> Why I Wanted To Do This
</h>

<p> Why I started is because is because in the past years of middle school i did basic coding, but nothing to this advcanced where I could actually write down the code and do it for myself,and show that it is more than is is made out to be. I also wanted more of a challenge because to potentially go to school for coding, you will need to know what attributes are, what are they used for, how to use them, etc. All that plays into making either a website, or a game, or a portfolio. What I thought was really cool is the different types of code that I could experience and carry on for the rest of my life incase I started a business and needed a webiste or maybe do it as a job in the near future.
